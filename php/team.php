         <h3>Meeting notes:</h3>
         <p><strong>9/20/20:</strong>  The primary goal of the meeting was assigning which pages each person should have.  All group members were present, which made deciding which pages each person wanted easy.  We also talked about how we wanted to approach the sitewide CSS file, along with how we wanted to "store" our code for access.</p>
         
         <p><strong>9/29/20:</strong> The main goal for meeting was to further develop what we wanted to do for sitewide styling.  In addition, we set a standard footer and menu, as well as helped each other out with the various issues we ran into while creating our pages.  All members also attended this meeting.</p>
        
         <p><strong>10/3/20:</strong> Discussing final code adjustments, going through Lexie's proofreading.
         </p>
         
         <p><strong>10/4/20:</strong> Final discussion of style, reviewed the references "about" and contributions "team" page.  Standardized the menu layout.
